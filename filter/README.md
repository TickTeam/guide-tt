### Examples

TickTick provides "**AND**" and "**OR**" for combining the around two filters to find the exact tasks you need in seconds, which could help to focus on the right things when used correctly.


#### What do "AND" and "OR" mean?
| Operator | Description |
| --- | :---: |
| **AND** | Tasks should meet both filters at the same time |
| **OR** | Tasks should meet at least one of the filters |

For example, the filter query "today **AND** high priority" will list all tasks that are due today and also with high priority.

Meanwhile, you can use them in the same filter like "today **OR** overdue" for searching tasks that are either due today or are overdue. (Only Tag has both "**AND**" and "**OR**" for choice, the others just support "**OR**" by default.)



#### Here are a few handy examples to try out:

| Filter query | What it does |
| --- | :---: |
| today **OR** high priority | Show all tasks that are either due today or with high priority. |
| next 7 days **AND** assigned to me | Show all tasks that are assigned to me and are also due next 7 days. |
| (today **OR** overdue)  **AND** high priority | Show all tasks that are either due today or are overdue and also with high priority. |
| (#computer **AND** #work) | Show all tasks are tagged with both #computer and #work. |
| inbox **AND** no date | Show all tasks without date in inbox. |
| (work **OR** team)  **AND** high priority | Show all tasks with high priority in either "work" or "team" project. |
