### How to order tasks?

In the main task view, click the "sort" icon (the small clock with an arrow pointing downward). Then choose a sort type: list name, task time, task name, task priority.

You may also change the order of a task by clicking on the three horizontal lines to the left of the task's checkbox and dragging it to your preferred location.
