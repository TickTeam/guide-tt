###Statistics 

**Completion Rate of the Week**
TickTick wants to help you to gain a more accurate result when doing weekly reviews and not just helplessly seeing some overdue tasks lying there. Therefore, we implement the statistics function, in which for example it will indicate the completion rates of your tasks. 

**How It Works：**

The task numbers that you’ve accomplished / total task numbers you scheduled for this week = This week’s completion rate

<br />

**Other Statistics:**

Other than your achievement and completion rate, you may discover more of your performance with "Best Working Day" function and "Recent Completed Tasks" function.

If enabled the pomodoro function, you can use the "Most Focused Hours" function to find out your best concentrated hours during the day and start to arrange this particular period for your most important tasks. Also, with the "Recent Pomodoros" function to view your recent performance of concentration. 

Moreover, premium users will have the ability to look back on the statistics data of the past six weeks (or months) and encourage yourself to achieve more goals in the future .
