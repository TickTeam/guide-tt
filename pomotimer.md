####How to custom my Pomo settings?
1. Go to Settings, then tap "Pomo Timer".
2. Customize the settings such as Short break Duration, Long Break Duration,etc.

**Tips** :"Lights on" is a function that will allow the screen to remain bright during a Pomo once you turn it on.

####Can I skip to break or pause a Pomo?
Sorry, you can't. Except for abandoning the current pomo, the function is not designed to be interrupted by other actions. The Pomo Timer was developed based on The Pomodoro Tehcnique - one of the most useful time management methods in the world. For more info: https://cirillocompany.de/pages/pomodoro-technique
