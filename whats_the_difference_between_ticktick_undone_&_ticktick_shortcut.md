###What’s the difference between TickTick Undone & TickTick Shortcut?

There is a number icon on TickTick Undone 1×1, which counts the number of your overdue tasks plus today’s tasks. If your overdue & today’s tasks are more than 9, it will display 9+ instead of the actual number. TickTick Shortcut 1*1 is only an icon on your home screen for quick access.

(PS: Some android devices don't have TickTick Shortcut 1*1)
