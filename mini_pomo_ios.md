####How to minimize the pomo timer?
Once a pomo's started, a "Minimize" botton will appear under the "Exit" at the bottom. Tap on it and select to minimize the pomo timer. With the minimized pomo timer, you can then add more tasks or accomplish other things in TickTick. Your pomo will still be functioning and calculating in the background. 


You can check the pomo status from the red circle that's running around the pomo timer icon from the left side bar. The circle will automically turn to green at the break time and a notification banner will appear to remind you as well.
