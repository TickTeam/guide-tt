### How to add comment to a task?

"Comment" is always used to add extra remarks to a task. Within a shared list, all shared members can comment on any tasks to realize real chat & communication. If you want to reply to someone's comment in a shared list, you can enter "@" to bring up a list of members who share the list, or tap a member's icon to reply to that person directly.
