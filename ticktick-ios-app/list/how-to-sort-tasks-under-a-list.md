### How to sort tasks under a list?

In any list view, you can drag and drop to manually change tasks order. Also, you may use the auto sort functions to sort your tasks faster and neater.

How: In a list view, tap the "..." icon at the top right corner - Sort

You can choose a sort rule from **Date, Title, Tag, Priority**. Note that to use two sort rules at the same time is not supported. ![](../../../images/ticktick-ios-app/list/IMG_2312.PNG)
