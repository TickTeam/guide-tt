### How to change the order of the tasks?

1. Sign in to TickTick on the web.

2. Click on a list, then click the "View" icon.

3. Choose the sorting view you prefer. Tasks in self-defined lists and in the "Inbox" are sortable by order, due date, title, and priority. Tasks in a shared list can be sorted by assignee. Tasks in the "All" list can be sorted by list.

Tasks in "Today" and "Next 7 Days" can't be sorted automatically. Instead you can drag and drop tasks to change their order.
