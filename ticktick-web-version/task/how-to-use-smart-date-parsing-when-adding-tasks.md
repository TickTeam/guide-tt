### How to use Smart Date Parsing when adding tasks?

Date & time information you type in the name of your task will be recognized as the due date and a reminder will automatically be set.

For example, if you want to go to library on July 30 at 2:00 p.m., you just need to type: "Go to library July 30 2 pm" when naming this task. TickTick will automatically recognize July 30 as the task's due date and will set a reminder for 2:00 p.m. on that date. ![](../../../images/ticktick-web-version/task/2.6.2.1.png)

#### How to remove date & time info from task content when using Smart Date Parsing?

If you prefer date and time not showing in your task content after you create a task, click Settings then choose "Remove Text in Tasks" from the "Smart Date Parsing" drop-down options. ![](../../../images/ticktick-web-version/task/2.6.2.2.png)
