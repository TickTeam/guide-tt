####Can I skip to break or pause a Pomo?
Sorry, you can't. Except for abandoning the current pomo, the function is not designed to be interrupted by other actions. The Pomo Timer was developed based on The Pomodoro Technique - one of the most useful time management methods in the world. For more info: https://cirillocompany.de/pages/pomodoro-technique
