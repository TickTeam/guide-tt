You can sort items by List, Tag, Date, Priority, Assignee. These Filters are flexible enough to help you generate your own Smart List.

If you need to focus on only items you marked with high priority in TickTick, just choose "High priority", "Today", and "Tomorrow" in the Smart List filters menu to create a custom smart list which you can name "High Priority" or some similar name.
