## What’s the difference between TickTick Undone & TickTick shortcut?
There is a number icon on TickTick Undone 1×1, which counts the number of your overdue tasks plus today’s tasks. If your overdue & today’s tasks are more than 9, it will display 9+ instead of the actual number. TickTick shortcut 1*1 , however, is only an icon on your homescreen for quick access.
