### What does the app badge count for?

The small red badge that hovers over the TickTick app icon counts the number of "Today & Overdue" tasks by default. You can choose the task types to be counted in the App Badge.

1. Open TickTick on your iOS device and slide the screen to the right.

2. Tap the gear-shaped icon in the upper-right corner.

3. Tap "Preferences" and then tap "App Badge" to choose the task type\(s\) you wish to include in the App Badge count.
