### How to cancel my subscription? What about refund?

Refunds are available within **14 days** after the purchase. If you upgraded with Android or Web, please provide your **TickTick account** and **transaction ID** to support@ticktick.com with a refund request. If you upgraded with iOS, you will need to ask Apple for refund because of the Apple's limits. Here is the link to report your request to Apple: https://reportaproblem.apple.com/ 

Meanwhile, you should cancel the subscription from the platform where you purchased TickTick to ensure that you'll not be charged again.
