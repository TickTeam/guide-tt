### How Smart Date Parsing works in TickTick

Smart Date Parsing provides a much easier way for users to set date & reminder efficiently in the application. When adding a task via typing or voice, information on dates will be automatically parsed and set on your calendar. However, not all the date formats can be recognized by Smart Date Parsing. Below are some examples of the date formats you can use in TickTick.

#### Date & Time

| What you type | How TickTick parses |
| :--- | :--- |
| today | Today |
| tomorrow | Tomorrow |
| monday | Monday \(Also works as "mon"\) |
| next monday | Next Monday \(Also works as "next mon"\) |
| march | March 1 \(Also works as "mar"\) |
| mar 6 | the next Mar 6 \(Also work as "march 6, 3/6, 03/06, 3-6, 03-06"\) |
| mar 6, 2018 | Mar 6, 2018 \(Also work as "march 6, 2018, 2018/3/6, 2018/03/06, 3/6/2018, 03/06/2018"\) |
| 9:00 | the next 9:00 |
| 9 pm | the next 9 pm \(Also works as "9pm, 9 PM, 9 p.m., 9:00 pm"\) |
| mar 6, 9 pm | 9 pm on the next March 6 |
| morning | the next 9 am |
| noon | the next 12 pm |
| afternoon | the next 1 pm |
| evening | the next 5 pm |
| night | the next 8 pm |
| midnight | the next 12 am |

When you create a task with unclear date information, TickTick will automatically parse it on the most recent date & time. For example, if typing "remind me at 9:00" at 4 pm, a task thatâ€™s due on today 9 pm will be created.
