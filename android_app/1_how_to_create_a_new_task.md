### How to create a new task?

With TickTick, you have six different ways to add a new task, giving you the power to choose a method that works best for you.


**Option 1: Add a task to the Quick Add Bar with a due date.**

"Quick add" is enabled by default, you can create a task by typing at the bottom of the task page (or by tapping the microphone icon to use voice input - see Option 5 below). Choose a due date and time by tapping the calendar icon.

##### **Smart Date Parsing when adding tasks from Quick Add bar**


If you type or say the date and time information for your task when using the Quick Add bar, TickTick will automatically set the date you gave as due date and set the time you gave as the time for that task to occur.

For example, if you want to go to library on next Saturday at 2 pm, you just need to type: "Go to library next Saturday 2 pm", then TickTick will automatically recognize the date of next Saturday as the task’s due date and set 2 pm as its reminder.

You can also select a list to add your new task to when using the Quick Add Bar. Tap the icon marked "Inbox" above the Quick Add Bar and select a list from the choices given or create a new list.

**Note**: Can’t see quick add bar, only a "+" icon?

Go to "Advanced Settings" -> "Quick Add" -> Double check whether you’ve enabled it

#####Remove date & time info from task content when using Smart Date Parsing

If you prefer date and time not showing in your task content after your task is created, tap Settings > Advanced Settings > Smart Date Parsing, then select "Remove Text in Tasks"

After "Remove Text in Tasks" is enabled, the highlighted date & time text will be removed from the text of your task.
