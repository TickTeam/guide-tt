### How to add comment on a task?
1.Open TickTick on your android device.

2.Enter a task detail page to tap the option menu in the upper right hand corner.

If it is in a shared list, all members can view your comments and make comments as well.



“Comment” is always used to add extra remarks to a task. Within a shared list, all shared members can comment on any tasks to realize real chat & communication. If you want to @reply someone in a shared list, you can enter “@” to select a member or click the icon to reply someone directly.
