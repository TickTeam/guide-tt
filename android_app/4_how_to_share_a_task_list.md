**-Option 2: Share via link**

Link is an easier way to share lists. You only need to send the link via social platform. If someone clicks the link, TickTick will send a notification asking you whether you would like to add he or she to the list. If you agree, the shared list will be copied to your friends’ TickTick account automatically.
