1. Open TickTick on your Android device, then either swipe to the right or tap the hamburger button in the upper-left corner.

2. Tap "Manage List" at the bottom of the list menu.

3. Tap "Smart List" in the upper-right corner.

4. Tap "Completed", then tap "Show".

You can show or hide any list using this procedure, except for the Inbox List. The Inbox List cannot be hidden.
