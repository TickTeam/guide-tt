### Why I can’t use premium features after I purchased TickTick?

Upon completion of your payment, normally you can enjoy premium features. If not, you should try to restore TickTick.

1.Open TickTick on your android device, and slide the screen to the right.

2.Tap your avatar in the upper left hand corner to enter account details.

3.Tap"My Pro" and then tap “Restore” at the bottom of of the new page.

If “Restore” doesn't work, please do not hesitate to contact us: support@ticktick.com
