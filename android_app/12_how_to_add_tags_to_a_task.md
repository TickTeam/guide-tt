### How to add tags to a task?

The "Tags" list helps you filter and find similar tasks in TickTick. The "Tags" list is hidden by default. For more details about how to enable the "Tags" list, please see section 2.2.1.

You can attach at most five tags per task. To tag a task, simply add a hashtag to a keyword (for example, "#office"). Then just add the word "#office" to all tasks that you believe should be labeled with the "office" tag. In the list menu you can search the Tags lists to see all the tasks that have been labeled with a specific tag.
