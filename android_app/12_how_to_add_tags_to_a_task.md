### How to add “Tags” to a task?
“Tags” list helps you filter all of your tasks in TickTick. “Tags” list is hidden by default. Please turn to 2.3.1 to learn how to enable Tags.

To tag a to-do, simply add a hashtag to a keyword. For example, #office. Then just add the word “#office” to all relevant tasks.

You can attach at most 5 tags to each task. When clicking “Tags” list, you will be directed to the list, where includes all tasks labeled by this tag.
