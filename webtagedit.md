### How to edit / delete a tag?

Once you have a commonly used tag thatâ€™s associated with many tasks, edit the tag name or delete the tag and auto remove it from all tasks would be very useful. In TickTick, you can batch edit tags without going into each task. 

How: Click the "..." icon on the right side of a tag name - Select to edit / delete
