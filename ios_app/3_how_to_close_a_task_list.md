### What's the difference between closed lists and hidden lists?

Some "Smart lists" in TickTick, such as “Today” and “Completed”，can be hidden if you want to keep the interface clean and improve app performance.

Self-defined lists can be both hidden and closed. For example, if you have a list which is about your future plan and it is inactive temporarily, you can choose to hide it, so that its tasks won’t be displayed in “All” & other smart lists. However, if you close a list, it will be moved into the “Closed Lists”, and the tasks within this list will not be remindered & displayed in search results any more.
