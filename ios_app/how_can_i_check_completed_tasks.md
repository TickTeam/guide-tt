### Where can I check completed tasks?
You can check all completed tasks in “Completed”. “Completed” list is hidden by default, you can enable it by editing smart lists (turn to 3.3.1 for details).

Tasks in “Completed” has been sorted by completion date, and you can choose to view all completed tasks in a specific list by clicking the icon of "funnel" on the top right of the page.
