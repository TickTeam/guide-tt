### Why I can't use premium features after purchasing TickTick?

Upon completion of your payment, normally you can enjoy premium features. But if you can’t, you should: 

1.Slide the screen to the right.

2.Click the gear-shaped icon in the upper-right hand of the screen.

3.Click “Upgrade to Pro”.

4.Click "Restore Purchases" at the bottom of the page.

**If it doesn't work, please contact us via email: support@ticktick.com**
