### How to assign a task?
Please note that the person you want to assign a task to has to accept your invitation to a shared list before TickTick will assign them responsibility for that task.


1. Open TickTick on your iOS device and swipe the screen to the right, then select a shared list, then choose a task in the shared list.

2. Tap the assign button. This is the icon of a human bust with a small arrow pointing rightward. This icon is found in the upper-right corner.

3. Tap the avatar of member you want to assign the task to, then finish choosing recipients.
