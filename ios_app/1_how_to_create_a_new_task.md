**-Option 1: Add Button**

You can choose a list first, and then tap “+” icon at the bottom of the task page to enter a new task.

**-Option 2: Pull-down Screen **

1.Pull down the screen.

2.In the “Today” section, tap “Add New” if you have already added TickTick in “Today”.

*If TickTick is not in “Today” section, you should add it first by tapping “Edit” at the bottom. 

<br />

**-Option 3: Voice Input**

1.Tap and hold “+” at the bottom of the task page.

2.Start speaking. For example, “Have lunch with Jack tomorrow at 13”.

You will find the task added with due date (tomorrow) and reminder time (13). 

If you find TickTick can't recognize what you speak, you should check “Voice typing langugae” first. Turn to 3.1.12 for more details.
