### How many “Smart lists” are there in TickTick?
There are 7 default lists in TickTick: All, Today, Next 7 Days, Inbox, Calendar, Completed, and Tags. Some of them are closed by default, so you need to enable them manually.

<br />
#####Take “Completed” as an example:
1.Open TickTick, and slide the screen to the right.

2.Click gear-shaped icon in the upper-right hand of the screen.

3.Select “Smart List”.

4.The status of “Completed” is “Hidden”, so you can tap to enable it.
