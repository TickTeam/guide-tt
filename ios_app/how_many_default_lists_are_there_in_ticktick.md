### How many “Smart lists” are there in TickTick?
There are 7 default lists in TickTick: “All, Today, Next 7 Days, Inbox, Calendar, Completed, and Tags”. Some of them are hidden as default, and you can make them visible in the task list.

<br />
#####Take “Completed” as an example:
1.Slide the screen to the right.

2.Click gear-shaped icon.

3.Choose “Smart List”

4.The status of “Completed” is “Hide”, so you can tap the buttom to make it visible.

Except “Inbox”, any other lists can be hidden in task list.
