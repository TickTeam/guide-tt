### How to create a recurring task?
You can set different recurring modes for tasks in TickTick. Once you check off a recurring task, the task will roll to the next recurring date according to the repeating interval. After you enter the setting page of due date, you can tap the Repeat bar to set repetition interval and “Repeat Ends”.

If you want to select repeating dates by yourself, you can choose “Custom”. Then you will be led to set “Repeat Type” (Due date/Completion date), “Frequency” (Daily/Weekly/Monthly), and the repeating interval.
