### How to add “Tags” to a task?
The “Tags” list is hidden by default. So, you should first show it by editing Smart lists (Turn to 3.3.1 for details). Then, you can start creating tasks by adding the “#” symbol in front of any word or phrase.

You can attach at most 5 tags to each task. When clicking on the “Tags”, you will be directed to the list, where all tasks labeled by this tag will be displayed.
