### How to change the order of the tasks?
Open TickTick on your iOS device and tap the option menu in the upper-right hand corner of the screen to select “Sort”.

Tasks under self-defined lists and “Inbox” can be sorted by order, due date, title, and priority. Tasks in a shared list can be sorted by assignee, and tasks in “All” can be sorted by their “List”.

Tasks in “Today” and “Next 7 Days” can't be sorted automatically. Instead you can drag and drop tasks to change their order.
