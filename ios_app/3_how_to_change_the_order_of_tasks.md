### How to sort tasks?
Tap the option menu in the upper-right hand of the screen to select “Sort”.

Tasks in “Inbox” and self defined lists can be sorted by custom, due date, title, and priority. Tasks in shared lists can also be sorted by assignee.

Tasks in “Today” and “Next 7 Days” can't be sorted automatically, but you can manually drag tasks.
