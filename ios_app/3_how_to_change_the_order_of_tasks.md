### How to sort tasks?
Tap the option menu in the upper-right hand of the screen to select “Sort”.

Tasks in “Inbox” and self defined lists can be sorted by custom, due date, title, and priority. Shared tasks can also be sorted by assignee.

Tasks in “Today” and “Next 7 Days” can't be sorted, but you can manually drag tasks.
