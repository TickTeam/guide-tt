### How to sort tasks?
Open TickTick on mobile and tap the option menu in the upper-right hand corner of the screen to select “Sort”.

Tasks in “Inbox” and self defined lists can be sorted by custom, due date, title, and priority. Tasks in shared lists can also be sorted by assignee.

Tasks in “Today” and “Next 7 Days” can't be sorted automatically, but instead you can drag and drop them to change their order.
