-**Can I cancel anytime?**

Yes, you can cancel the subscription anytime. 

If you cancel the subscription within 14 days, you can get refund (turn to 0.5 for details), and your account will be downgraded immediately. 

If you cancel the subscription after 14 days, you can't get refund. The subscription will last until the end of the month or year depending on what you initially chose, and once PRO expires, your account will be downgraded to a free account. 

-**If I have 25 lists, will I lost lists and tasks after my account is downgraded to a free one?**

Free user are allowed to have only 19 lists, while Pro users can have at most 99 lists (for more details about premium features in TickTick, please turn to 0.3). If have 25 lists and your account is downgraded, your data (lists, tasks, images, etc.) won't be lost, but you are not allowed to add more, since you have already exceeded the upper limit for free account.
