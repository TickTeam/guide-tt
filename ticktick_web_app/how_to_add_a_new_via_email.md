###How to add a new task via email?

If your email inbox is full of to-dos, you can turn them into tasks using Mail Service in TickTick.

1.Sign in TickTick on web.

2.Click your avatar in the upper right hand corner of the page.

3.Select “Settings”, and click “Mail Service”.

There are two email address for you:

**<mark>todo@mail.ticktick.com</mark>**: If you sign in TickTick with an email, then you can email your task via your regitered email to it.


**<mark>todo+####@mail.ticktick.com<mark>**: It is generated for your TickTick account. So you can email your task via any email to it.


The subject of the email will be the title of the task, while the content of the email will be task details. Beside, you can add date and reminder time to the email subject. For example, you can write “Go to Starbucks with Frank tomorrow 4pm” or “Go shopping 2/4 4pm” in the subject, then you will find this task in TickTick’s “Inbox” with due date (tomorrow or Feb 4) and reminder time (4 pm).
