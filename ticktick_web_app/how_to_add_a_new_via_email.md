###How to add a new task via email?
1.Click your avatar on top right corner to enter “Settings”, and then choose “Mail Service”.

2.There are two email address for you:

One is **<mark>todo@mail.ticktick.com</mark>**. If you sign in TickTick with an email, then you can email your task via your regitered email to todo@mail.ticktick.com


The other one is **<mark>todo+####@mail.ticktick.com<mark>** which is generated only for your TickTick account. So you can  email your task via any email to todo+**********@mail.ticktick.com


The subject of the email will be the title of the task while the content of the email will be task details. Beside, you can add date and reminder time on the email subject. For example, you can write “Go to Starbucks with Frank tomorrow 4pm” or “Go shopping 2/4 4pm” in the subject, then you will find this task in TickTick’s “Inbox” with due date (tomorrow or Feb 4) and reminder time (4 pm).
