Closing inactive lists helps streamline your TickTick homepage sidebar and improve TickTick's performance. If you don't want to delete the list, closing it will save its contents in TickTick. However, please note that tasks on closed lists will not be displayed in "All", "Today", "Next 7 Days" or search results. In addition, you will not be reminded of tasks in a closed list.
