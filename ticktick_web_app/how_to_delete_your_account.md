###Can I delete my account?

Are you serious? I feel sorry to hear that:-( Hope you can contact us if you have any issues when using TickTick.

**-How to delete account?**

1.Click the avatar on top right corner.

2.Click “Settings”, and then choose “Account”.

3.Click “Delete account”.

Deleting account will remove all data from TickTick. Thus for cautious purpose, you will be asked to enter your password for confirmation. If you've forgotten your password, you are suggested to reset your password first.
