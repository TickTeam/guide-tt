**-How to delete TickTick account?**

1.Click the avatar in the upper-right corner of the screen.

2.Click “Settings”, and then choose “Account”.

3.Click “Delete account” at the bottom.

Deleting account will remove all your data from TickTick. Thus for cautious purpose, you will be asked to enter your password for confirmation. If you've forgotten your password, you are suggested to reset your password first.
