###Can I delete my account?

Are you serious? I am sorry to hear about that:-( Hope you can check out more features of TickTick.

**-How to delete account?**

1.Click the avatar on top right corner.

2.Enter “Settings” > “Account”.

3.Click “Delete account”.

Please note deleting account will remove all data from TickTick and therefore, for cautious purpose, you will be asked to enter your password for confirmation. If you've forgotten your password, you are suggested to reset your password first.
