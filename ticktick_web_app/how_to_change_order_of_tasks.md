###How to change order of tasks within a list?

1.Select a list first and click the “View” icon on top right corner of the middle panel.

2.Then, you can choose to sort tasks by due dates, by title, by order, by priority, and by assignee (shared lists only).


If you choose “by title”, tasks will be ordered alphabetically. If you choose “by order”, then, you can drag tasks to manually change their order per your own preferences.

-What's the sorting mode in Today?

Tasks in “Today” list will be sorted by reminder time automatically. However, if you can manually drag tasks in “Today” list, auto sorting mode will be disabled for that day. No worries, because it will be back the next day.
