###How to add tag to a task?

Tags help you filter your to-dos across multiple lists. To check all tasks labeled by tags, you should first enable “TAGS” in Labs:

1.Click your avatar in the upper-right hand of the page to select “Labs”.

2.Enable “Tags”.

3.You will find "TAGS" list in the List page.

Tag is another way to group tasks, which is especially used to add context for your tasks. To tag a to-do, simply add a hashtag to a keyword. Each task is allowed to be labeled by at most 5 tags.
