### How to move a task from one list to another?

Sometimes you create tasks in a Smart List, such as “Next 7 Days” and “Today”, but it doesn't belong to any self-defined lists. When you sort out these tasks, you'd better move them to self-defined list, where you can check tasks conveniently. Use the following steps to move a task from one list to another:

1.Open TickTick and select a task.

2.Tap the option menu in the upper-right hand of the screen.

3.Tap “Move to” to choose a new list for this task.
