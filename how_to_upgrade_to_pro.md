**If I have more than 19 lists, will I lose your lists and tasks after my account is downgraded to a free one?**

Free accounts get a maximum of 19 lists. Premium accounts can have up to 99 lists. For additional features in TickTick, please turn to 0.3). If you have 25 lists and your account is downgraded, your data (lists, tasks, images, etc.) won't be lost, but you are not allowed to add more, because you have already exceeded the upper limit for free account.
