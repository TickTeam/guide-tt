# How to use Smart Date Parsing when adding tasks?

Date & time information you type will be recognized as dua date and reminder when adding tasks.

For example, if you want to go to library on July 30 at 2 pm, you just need to type: “Go to library July 30 2 pm”, then TickTick will automatically recognize July 30 as the task’s due date and set 2 pm as its reminder.
