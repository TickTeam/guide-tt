###What is list folder?###

List folders can help to group related lists together. When you came to TickTick for the first time, you have been given two lists named “Work” & “Family”. Then, as time goes by, you keep adding more lists like “Books to read”, “Movies to watch”, just to name a few and finally, you have to scroll down the screen to check the list at the bottom.  Really annoying. “List Folder” has came to your rescue.

**How to create list folder?**

1.Open TickTick on your android device.

2.Slide the screen to the right, and then tap “Edit List” at the bottom.

3.Select a list that you want to add to a folder. 

4.Tap “New Folder” or select a existing folder for this list.

Another easy way to create folders is to drag a list on top of another one that you’d like to include in the same folder. Hover your selected list until a blue box appears around the second list. Then drop the selected list, and you can enter a name for the folder.
