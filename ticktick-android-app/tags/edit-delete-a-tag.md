### How to edit / delete existing tags

Once you have a commonly used tag thatâ€™s associated with many tasks, edit the tag name or delete the tag and auto remove it from all tasks would be very useful.

Two ways to do it: 1. Manage Lists & Tags - Tags - Select the tag you want to edit / delete 2. Long press on a tag name at the left sidebar - Tag the "Edit" icon

Note: You can set a tag color in "Edit" as well.
