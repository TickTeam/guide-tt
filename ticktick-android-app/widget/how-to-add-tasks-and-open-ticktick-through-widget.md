### How to add tasks and open TickTick through widget?

You can directly add tasks through all sizes of widgets without opening the TickTick app. Tap "+" in the upper right hand of the widget to create a task, then tap the send button to send the new task to TickTick.

Tap a specific task on the widget to enter its detail page, or click on any of the tasks to open a list view in TickTick.
