### How to swipe on a task to start a pomo?

Go to the Settings page->General->Swipes->custom one of the swipe options as "Start pomo". For example, "Short Swipe Right" in the pic below.

After it's done, go back to the list view and find a task that you want to focus working on. Swipe on it as how you set.
