### How to upload an attachment to a task?

1. Open TickTick on your Android device, and enter a task in the Task tab page.

2. Tap the option menu in the upper-right corner, then tap "Attachment".

You can add images, audios, videos or other regular files to a task. If the task is stored in a shared list, all members of the list can view and save any such files attached thereto.
