### How to close a task list?
Click the bulleted list icon on the top left of the toolbar to switch to the task lists page. Then, click the downward arrow of your chosen list and click “Close”. Please note after closing a list, tasks within that list will not be displayed in “All”, “Today” and “Next 7 days”. In addition, tasks within that list won’t be reminded any more.
