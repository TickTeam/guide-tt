**-Why “Add to TickTick” doesn't work?**

First, after you install TickTick Chrome extension, you should close the browser and then open it again, otherwise the functions you mentioned aren't available.

"Add to TickTick" in the drop-down menu is not available in the Gmail page. Instead, you can tap "Add to TickTick" button on the top of the email detailed page directly.
