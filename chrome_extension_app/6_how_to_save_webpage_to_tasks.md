### How to save webpages to tasks?
1. Right click anywhere on a webpage and choose the "Add to TickTick" option from the dropdown menu.

2. A dialog box will appear with the URL for the webpage displayed in the task description. You can edit this content, set a due date and time, and save it as a task in TickTick.

**Why “Add to TickTick” doesn't work?**

1. Close and reopen your browser.  "Add to TickTick" is not added as a dropdown menu option in your browser until you close the browser at least once after loading the TickTick Chrome Extension.

2. The "Add to TickTick" drop-down menu item is not available in the Gmail page. Instead, you can tap "Add to TickTick" button on the top of the email detailed page directly.
